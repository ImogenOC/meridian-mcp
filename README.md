# Meridian-MCP

Meridian-MCP lets AI coding assistants search and inspect DreamMaker / SS13 projects through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides code navigation, static diagnostics, icon and map inspection, and optional BYOND build, debugging and profiling tools.

**Analysis mode is read-only and enabled by default.** Development mode adds compilation, generated files and runtime control when explicitly configured.

- **Code:** search a large repository, inspect exact symbols, and find definitions, references and diagnostics.
- **Assets:** inspect and compare DMI icons; search, diff and render DMM/TGM maps.
- **Development:** compile, run a local world, call project test hooks, debug with auxtools, and profile with Tracy.

## Authority and safety boundaries

Parsing checks source with SpacemanDMM and DreamChecker. It does **not** prove that DreamMaker compiles the project or that the game works. Use the repository's documented build and test commands for those checks.

The server only accesses roots authorized at startup. Development executables must be allowlisted, runtime connections stay on loopback, and process controls target only server-owned processes. Tool calls cannot expand these permissions. See the [security model](docs/security.md) for details.

## Five-minute analysis setup

For Codex on Windows, with Rust and the Windows C++ build tools installed:

1. Build the release binary with the repository-pinned Rust toolchain:

   ```powershell
   cargo +1.95.0 build --locked --release
   ```

2. Add this entry to your existing Codex `config.toml`. Replace both example paths with existing absolute paths:

   ```toml
   [mcp_servers.meridian-mcp]
   command = 'C:\path\to\meridian-mcp\target\release\meridian-mcp.exe'

   [mcp_servers.meridian-mcp.env]
   MERIDIAN_MCP_MODE = 'analysis'
   MERIDIAN_MCP_ROOTS = 'C:\path\to\Meridian-Rift'
   ```

3. Restart Codex, call `dm_server_status`, then call `dm_parse_environment` with the contained `.dme` path. Parse again after source changes; an unchanged environment reuses the active snapshot rather than reparsing.

Analysis mode needs no BYOND installation. HTML generation requires development mode and a packaged, verified dmdoc helper.

## Development setup

Use the installer and configuration updater to validate the binary, helpers, authorized roots and private state directory. Requirements depend on the tools you enable:

| Capability | Additional prerequisite |
| --- | --- |
| Direct compilation and normal runtime | An allowlisted BYOND installation containing `dm.exe` and its sibling runtime executables |
| Meridian-Rift full build | Windows, an authorized Meridian-Rift checkout, and `MERIDIAN_MCP_RIFT_BUILD=offline` or `network` |
| HTML documentation | Exact dmdoc helper recorded by the helper manifest |
| Auxtools debugging | Packaged auxtools v2.3.7 DLL and the x86 Microsoft Visual C++ runtime |
| Tracy profiling | Manifest-verified host helper and x86 byond-tracy hook for the supported BYOND baseline |

The complete packaging example is in [Operator and contributor reference](#operator-and-contributor-reference). At minimum, development configuration sets `MERIDIAN_MCP_MODE=development`, supplies one or more roots, allowlists the compiler, and points `MERIDIAN_MCP_STATE_DIR` to an existing writable directory outside every workspace root. Restart the MCP client after changing startup authorization.

### Verify a Codex installation

Fully quit and reopen Codex after installing a binary or changing MCP settings. Closing a task alone does not restart the server.

From a terminal, run `codex mcp get meridian-mcp` and confirm the enabled entry points to the intended binary. Then check through Codex:

1. `dm_server_status`: confirm `mcp_build.complete: true`, the expected revision/hash and enabled capabilities.
2. `dm_parse_environment`: load an authorized `.dme`; expect `success: true` and `retrieval.lexical.status: ready`.
3. Repeat the parse: expect `reused: true` and the same `state_generation`.
4. `dm_check_errors`: expect `analysis.source: cached_snapshot` and `recomputed: false`.
5. `dm_search_context`: try a project-specific query and inspect an exact result.

A missing include or source diagnostic may be a checkout problem, not an installation failure. Read the error before changing files. Each restarted session needs a fresh parse.

## Common workflows

### Analyze code

1. `dm_parse_environment` loads an authorized `.dme` for analysis.
2. `dm_search_context` finds relevant code. Use `dm_search_symbols` for partial-name lookup.
3. Verify candidates with `dm_get_type`, `dm_get_proc`, `dm_get_var`, or `dm_get_definition`.
4. Use `dm_find_references`, `dm_find_implementations`, `dm_document_symbols`, and `dm_check_errors` for impact analysis.
5. Reparse after any source change. Parser success is not compiler success.

An unchanged environment reuses its snapshot. Reuse checks file paths, sizes and modification times, not content hashes; use `force: true` when you need a full reparse. Responses report timings and the active generation. Performance depends on the project and machine.

Search uses lexical BM25 ranking; embeddings and vector search are not configured. For a known symbol, use exact lookup. Procedure results distinguish the **implementation owner** (executable body) from the **declaration owner** (declaration metadata).

Diagnostics come from the last successful parse. Filter by file, severity, component or rule, and follow `pagination.next_cursor` for more results. `truncated: true` with `diagnostic_page_limit` means another page is available.

### Compile and exercise a world

`dm_compile` runs DreamMaker directly. For Meridian-Rift's full build, `rift_compile` runs the separate `RIFT_BUILD.cmd`; it does not replace the human `BUILD.cmd` workflow.

After building, use `dm_run` → `dm_wait_for_output` → `dm_topic` / `dm_status` → `dm_stop`. Topic requests need a test handler supplied by the project. See [build provenance and runtime integrity](#operational-details) for stale-artifact checks.

### Inspect icons and maps

Use `dm_dmi_info` before comparing or extracting DMI states. `dm_find_dmi_duplicates` looks across contained scopes for exact matches plus cropped, palette-only, mirrored, rotated, and scaled copies. `dm_audit_icons` checks statically resolvable inherited `icon` and `icon_state` references. Generated PNGs are written only by the explicit development tools and only to contained paths.

For maps, use `dm_map_info` for structure, `dm_find_on_map` for type-path occurrences, `dm_diff_maps` for coordinate-model differences, and `dm_list_render_passes` before `dm_render_map` or `dm_render_maps`.

### Debug with auxtools

Compile and parse matching source, launch the contained DMB with `dm_debug_launch`, configure breakpoints, continue or step, and inspect threads, frames, scopes, and variables after a stop event. The adapter owns one Windows BYOND host and does not attach to arbitrary processes. See the [detailed debugger workflow](#debugger-workflow) and the per-tool descriptions below.

### Profile with Tracy

Prepare the verified hook, launch an owned profiling runtime, capture one or more bounded windows, and inspect hotspots, zones, frames, comparisons, and repeated controls offline. Each accepted trace is paired with an identity and queue-health sidecar. See the [Tracy profiler](#tracy-profiler) reference and [native evidence analysis](docs/native-evidence.md).

## Capability and platform status

Core analysis, compilation, map tools and runtime controls are **provisional**. DMI analysis, HTML documentation, auxtools and Tracy are **experimental**. Optional tools appear only when their startup prerequisites are met.

Windows and Ubuntu have separate test evidence; macOS is unsupported and untested. Auxtools and Meridian-Rift's full-build wrapper are Windows-only. The inherited BYOND client login protocol is unsupported.

See [compatibility and evidence](docs/compatibility.md) for support definitions, tested versions and remaining integration gates. A passing fixture does not establish full-game compatibility.

## Complete tool reference

Analysis tools are read-only. Development mode adds compilation, file generation and runtime control. Full builds, debugging and Tracy need additional startup settings. See [tool contracts](docs/tool-contracts.md) for each tool's permissions, side effects, limits and support status.

### Auxtools debugger

Enable `MERIDIAN_MCP_DEBUGGER=auxtools` in development mode with the verified auxtools v2.3.7 DLL and x86 Microsoft Visual C++ runtime. The adapter is Windows-only and experimental.

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dm_debug_launch` | Launch an owned BYOND host: interactive DreamSeeker by default, or headless DreamDaemon. |
| `dm_debug_set_breakpoints` | Replace source breakpoints for one parsed file. |
| `dm_debug_set_function_breakpoints` | Replace breakpoints using exact procedure identities. |

| `dm_debug_source` | Read the session-provided `stddef.dm` through its issued reference. |
| `dm_debug_wait_for_event` | Wait for events after a sequence number; report dropped events. |
| `dm_debug_stop` | Disconnect and terminate the owned debugger process tree. |

#### Debugger workflow

1. Compile and parse matching source, then call `dm_debug_launch`.
2. Set the complete desired breakpoint list; each setter replaces its active set.
3. Continue or step with `dm_debug_control`, then wait with `dm_debug_wait_for_event` using the last event sequence.
4. Inspect `dm_debug_threads` → `dm_debug_stack_trace` → `dm_debug_scopes` → `dm_debug_variables`.
5. Call `dm_debug_stop` before rebuilding, reparsing changed source or ending the session.

Only one runtime can be active: normal, debugger or Tracy. The debugger does not support attaching to an existing process or selecting an arbitrary DLL. Expression evaluation runs game code and may have side effects.

### Tracy profiler

Enable `MERIDIAN_MCP_TRACY=byond` in development mode with both verified native helpers. The live baseline uses Tracy protocol 82 and BYOND 516.1687. See [Tracy setup and capture](docs/tracy-profiling.md) for packaging, supported versions and headless-world wake behavior.

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dm_tracy_prepare` | Install the verified profiling hook; replacing a different file requires explicit overwrite. |
| `dm_tracy_launch` | Start an owned profiling runtime and collector, then verify producer readiness. |
| `dm_tracy_capture` | Capture a bounded window and publish a validated trace with its evidence sidecar. |
| `dm_tracy_status` | Show runtime, collector, capture and queue-health status. |
| `dm_tracy_stop` | Stop the owned profiling session and finalize its integrity journal. |
| `dm_tracy_hotspots` | Rank procedures by time or call count. |
| `dm_tracy_zone` | Summarize an exact profiled procedure. |
| `dm_tracy_frame_stats` | Report ServerTick frame statistics and percentiles. |
| `dm_tracy_compare` | Compare two traces by procedure, file and line. |
| `dm_tracy_control_stats` | Check 3–20 compatible captures for variation and baseline eligibility. |

Offline trace analysis does not require a parsed environment. An active parse adds source correlation without changing measurements. Accepted traces retain identity and queue-health evidence; raw artifacts stay local.

## Operator and contributor reference

### Rust build and verification

The repository pins Rust 1.95.0 with rustfmt and Clippy to match CI. BYOND integration gates additionally require the project-pinned BYOND version. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before making code changes.

```powershell
cargo +1.95.0 fmt --all -- --check
cargo +1.95.0 clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --all-features
cargo +1.95.0 build --locked --release
cargo +1.95.0 deny check
```

The release binary is `target\release\meridian-mcp.exe` on Windows and `target/release/meridian-mcp` on Linux.

```

Add `-EnableTracy` to both installation and configuration only when the combined manifest contains the verified Tracy helper and hook. Restart Codex after changing its MCP configuration.

### Startup configuration

The server reads immutable startup configuration:

- `MERIDIAN_MCP_MODE`: `analysis` (default) or `development`.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_ROOTS`: semicolon-separated workspace roots on Windows; platform path-list syntax elsewhere.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_REPOSITORIES`: optional path list of explicitly authorized local Git working trees. At startup, Meridian-MCP discovers and verifies their linked worktrees using fixed local Git commands, then adds those exact canonical paths to the effective roots.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_COMPILERS`: allowlisted DreamMaker executables.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_STATE_DIR`: required in development mode. This existing writable private state directory must be outside every workspace root and stores local atomic build records, failed-attempt history, and runtime-integrity journals; it is never published as evidence. Multiple MCP processes may share it through operation-scoped operating-system locks.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_RIFT_BUILD`: `disabled` (default), `offline`, or `network`. The ceiling is immutable and `rift_compile` remains absent unless enabled.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_HELPER_MANIFEST`: build-produced manifest for the exact dmdoc helper; absent or mismatched helpers keep `dm_generate_docs` unavailable.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_DEBUGGER`: `disabled` (default) or `auxtools`. Auxtools requires development mode, one allowlisted `dm.exe`, its sibling `dreamseeker.exe`, and the fixed hash-verified DLL beside Meridian-MCP.
- `MERIDIAN_MCP_TRACY`: `disabled` (default) or `byond`. Tracy requires development mode and exact `tracy-server-helper` (host x86_64) and `byond-tracy` (x86) manifest entries for the current platform and BYOND baseline.

All roots and repositories must exist. `MERIDIAN_MCP_REPOSITORIES` also authorizes verified linked Git worktrees. `dm_server_status` reports those effective roots under `immutable_startup_roots`. Restart after changing permissions.

`rift_compile` defaults to `network_mode=offline`; `network_mode=allow` requires a startup ceiling of `network`. Offline mode configures cooperative package-manager restrictions, not an operating-system firewall.

The configuration updater expects the named server and environment tables to exist already. It updates the installed binary, manifest, roots, mode, state, debugger, and Tracy settings while preserving unrelated servers and existing keys such as the compiler allowlist and Rift build ceiling. A complete Windows development table can therefore look like this before or after the updater runs:

```toml
[mcp_servers.meridian-mcp]
command = 'C:\path\to\installed-meridian-mcp\meridian-mcp.exe'

[mcp_servers.meridian-mcp.env]
MERIDIAN_MCP_MODE = 'development'
MERIDIAN_MCP_ROOTS = 'C:\path\to\Meridian-Rift'
MERIDIAN_MCP_REPOSITORIES = 'C:\path\to\Meridian-Rift'
MERIDIAN_MCP_COMPILERS = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\BYOND\bin\dm.exe'
MERIDIAN_MCP_STATE_DIR = 'C:\path\to\private-meridian-state'
MERIDIAN_MCP_RIFT_BUILD = 'offline'
MERIDIAN_MCP_HELPER_MANIFEST = 'C:\path\to\installed-meridian-mcp\helpers\manifest.json'
MERIDIAN_MCP_DEBUGGER = 'auxtools'
MERIDIAN_MCP_TRACY = 'disabled'
```

## Operational details

A managed artifact records compiler, source and output identities. A later failed compile or changed recorded input/output makes it stale, and launch tools reject it. An unmanaged human-built DMB is marked `unverified`; set `require_verified_provenance` to reject it. Use `dm_check_fixture_sync` to check a declarative fixture before building. See [provenance](docs/provenance.md).

The private state directory stores build records and `runtime-integrity/` journals outside workspace roots. A five-second monitor records changes; status and stop also refresh the journal, including after natural process exit. Only exact owned files may be exempted. The server reports `source_integrity_warning` and never reverts workspace changes.

Native measurements before game start are labeled `pre_game_cumulative`, not presented as gameplay intervals. See [native evidence analysis](docs/native-evidence.md) for measurement and comparison rules.

AphelionDMM's adapter supports only parsing, map information and diagnostics through its [versioned compatibility declaration](tests/compatibility/aphelion-dmm.json).
