# Native evidence analysis

`dm_native_evidence_summary` and `dm_native_evidence_compare` inspect technical evidence without changing or publishing its raw files. Supported kinds are explicit: `byond_proc_profile_json`, `byond_sendmaps_json`, `performance_csv`, `runtime_jsonl`, and `event_jsonl`. There is no format autodetection or executable parser extension.

BYOND proc and sendmaps documents are a cumulative snapshot. Performance CSV is an interval series. Runtime and mapped event JSONL are event streams. Wall-clock time, BYOND world deciseconds, and artifact-local sample indexes remain separate. Named ranges are half-open: a timestamp at the end belongs to the following phase or remains unassigned. Cumulative evidence before `game_start` is labeled `pre_game_cumulative`; it is never stretched across later phases.

Numeric summaries use deterministic type-7 percentiles, including p50, p95, and p99, plus count, missing count, minimum, maximum, compensated mean, and sample standard deviation. Missing cells do not become zero. Unknown or unavailable measures remain explicit. Repeated comparisons with at least three runs also report coefficient of variation when the mean is nonzero.

## Privacy and interpretation

The default redaction is mandatory for player, client, account, key/ckey, mob, and Discord identifiers and their ID aliases. Protected fields cannot become group keys. Matching `name=value` segments in returned text are replaced with `<redacted>`. Raw artifacts remain local and unchanged.

An unverified summary is useful for local inspection, but comparison requires every run to carry the same current verified managed build, DMB, workload, phase, artifact-kind sequence, and metric coverage. A mismatch returns `evidence_identity_mismatch` before metric calculation. A fixture-green result is bounded technical evidence, not a production performance conclusion.

## Summary example

```json
{
  "artifacts": [{
    "kind": "performance_csv",
    "path": "evidence/performance.csv",
    "options": {"selected_metrics": ["tick_usage"], "wall_time_field": "timestamp"}
  }],
  "phases": [{
    "id": "steady",
    "wall_start": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "wall_end": "2026-01-01T00:05:00Z"
  }]
}
```

The schema-1 response contains each artifact's root-relative path, byte count, SHA-256, fixed semantics, classification, assigned phase when unambiguous, numeric summaries, redaction counts, and identity-verification status.

## Comparison example

```json
{
  "runs": [
    {"artifacts": [{"kind": "performance_csv", "path": "evidence/run-a.csv"}], "dmb_path": "build/game.dmb"},
    {"artifacts": [{"kind": "performance_csv", "path": "evidence/run-b.csv"}], "dmb_path": "build/game.dmb"}
  ]
}
```

The comparison response names the verified build record, run count, canonical metric keys, input values, two-run absolute/percentage deltas, and distributions for repeated runs.
