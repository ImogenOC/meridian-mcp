# Meridian-MCP Audit Remediation Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. Implementation is not authorized by the audit request; do not execute this plan until asked.

**Goal:** Correct the ten audit findings while preserving exact lookup, immutable startup policy, artifact evidence, and the existing tool surface.

**Architecture:** Enforce policy at the actual resource and process boundaries. Keep immutable analysis snapshots, but make their dependency identity complete and their workers cancellation-safe. Reuse existing process containment, private-state records, and bounded output rather than adding parallel ownership systems.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 1.95.0, Tokio, Rayon, rmcp 3.1.3, pinned SpacemanDMM `351ddc0ffb2439876d4565ce5130bb6b027ee605`, PowerShell 7, Windows BYOND, native Tracy helpers.

**Spec:** [Performance, integration, and functionality audit](../../audits/2026-09-05-performance-integration-functionality.md).

## Global constraints

- Baseline audited revision: `48d6d54160959eafcc4992e20e56cc586437709f`. Recheck HEAD and dirty work before implementation.
- Work in the existing checkout; preserve unrelated changes. Do not create a worktree, commit, push, install, or replace a running MCP without explicit authorization.
- Read current repository guidance and `TESTING.md` before editing. If a task reaches Meridian-Rift DM source, read its current style, standards, autodoc, and modularization guides first.
- Keep Rust at 1.95.0. A dependency change needed for transitive I/O policy must be narrow, pinned, and independently qualified; do not combine it with a general upgrade.
- Keep analysis mode free of compilation/runtime effects. Startup roots and capability ceilings remain immutable.
- Preserve failed-parse state, retained build artifacts, failed-attempt provenance, and explicit unverified results.
- Accept LF and CRLF in external inputs while preserving the repository's LF policy.
- Use only disposable fixtures for mutation and fault injection. Do not run destructive full-build compatibility against the primary Meridian-Rift checkout.
- Report Rust, installed stdio, native helper, full-corpus analysis, real BYOND runtime, hosted CI, and human acceptance separately.
- Keep durable reports free of account names and machine-specific absolute paths. Raw local logs remain ignored.

## Order and ownership boundaries

| Order | Task | Findings | Dependency | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Enforce final compiler selection | F2, P1 | None | Every selected compiler is allowlisted before spawn |
| 2 | Enforce transitive read policy | F1, P1 | None | Parser and dependent reads cannot escape startup roots |
| 3 | Repair snapshot dependency identity | F5, P2 | Task 2 | Authorized external includes and config discovery invalidate reuse |
| 4 | Establish trustworthy compile provenance | F3, P1 | Tasks 1–3 | Verified records describe the effective, stable build inputs |
| 5 | Own standard runtime process trees | F4, P1 | None | Stop, EOF, and owner failure clean up owned processes |
| 6 | Keep runtime controls responsive | F7, P2 | Task 5 | Output waits do not monopolize lifecycle control |
| 7 | Bound parse admission and cancellation | F6, P2 | Task 3 | End-to-end request deadline and one active parser worker |
| 8 | Bound and reuse decoded assets | F8/F9, P2 | Task 2 | Pre-allocation limits, bounded residency, effective cache hits |
| 9 | Bound Tracy transport and shutdown | F10, P2 | None | Backpressure cannot defeat control deadlines or forced cleanup |
| 10 | Qualify and prepare deployment handoff | All | Tasks 1–9 | Reviewed evidence matrix and explicit remaining gates |

Each task is independently reviewable. The order favors policy and artifact correctness over general speed tuning. Do not begin an unmeasured search-ranking rewrite or dense-retrieval implementation as part of this work.

## Task 1: Enforce final compiler selection

**Files:** modify `src/tools/compile.rs` and, if centralizing validation, `src/tools/mod.rs`; extend `tests/compiler_runner.rs` and `tests/config_and_paths.rs`.

**Interface:** the final `PathBuf` passed into `ProcessSpec.program` must be the canonical result of `PathPolicy::executable`, regardless of whether the client supplied it. Preserve `executable_not_allowed` for an explicitly denied executable.

- [x] Add a regression for an empty allowlist and omitted `compiler_path`; assert a policy/configuration error and zero process-start evidence.
- [x] Add cases for a sole allowlisted compiler, a different conventional installation, and several allowlisted compilers. Use the existing test-executable fixture pattern in `tests/compiler_runner.rs` so the negative gate does not require BYOND.
- [x] Reproduce the existing defect with the caller payload below, then resolve default selection from immutable configuration and validate it before argument construction/spawn.

```json
{"name":"dm_compile","arguments":{"dme_path":"<owned fixture DME>","timeout_ms":1}}
```

- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test compiler_runner --test config_and_paths`. Verify that explicitly selecting and implicitly selecting the same denied compiler produce the same policy outcome.

**Done:** no branch reaches spawn with an unvalidated compiler; no new general executable fallback is introduced.

## Task 2: Enforce transitive read policy

**Files:** modify `src/tools/parse.rs`, `src/tools/mod.rs`, `src/path_policy.rs`, and affected source/icon adapters; extend `tests/config_and_paths.rs` and `tests/analysis_snapshot.rs`. If pinned SpacemanDMM has no supported loader hook, a narrow reviewed parser dependency patch also touches `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, its revision registries/build scripts, and matching CI pins.

**Interface:** carry the immutable `PathPolicy` from `ToolExecutionContext` into every analysis operation that can open derived paths. Canonicalize each path against all effective roots; do not substitute the DME parent for startup policy.

- [x] Create a temporary parent containing `allowed/fixture.dme` and sibling `external.dm`. Give the server only `allowed` as a root. Use this fixture content:

```dm
// allowed/fixture.dme
#include "../external.dm"
```

```dm
// external.dm
/datum/audit_external
	proc/read_marker()
		return "AUDIT_OUTSIDE_ROOT"
```

- [x] Verify the current escape, then add rejection tests that preserve the prior generation and never expose the marker. Test both direct includes and conditional nested includes. Add platform-supported symlink/junction cases.
- [x] Inspect the exact pinned preprocessor's file-open path. Enforce containment there through a supported loader hook or a narrowly pinned upstream patch. A text-only include pre-scan or filtering the final index is not an acceptable security boundary.
- [x] Add a positive case where both the DME root and sibling root are explicitly authorized. Exercise exact proc inspection and search as well as parsing.
- [x] Audit icon references and map rendering resource opens for the same transitive policy path; add a contained resource and an escaping resource case before changing those adapters.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test config_and_paths --test analysis_snapshot --test map_capabilities --test dmi_analysis` and the analysis stdio smoke.

**Done:** policy covers actual derived reads, and valid multi-root projects remain supported. Record any upstream dependency work explicitly rather than weakening root enforcement to avoid it.

## Task 3: Repair snapshot dependency identity

**Files:** modify `src/analysis_snapshot.rs`, `src/source_fingerprint.rs`, `src/project.rs`, `src/tools/parse.rs`; extend `tests/analysis_snapshot.rs`, `tests/project_profile.rs`, and parse unit tests.

**Interface:** `AnalysisSnapshot::source_inputs()` describes all authorized parser inputs. Configuration discovery contributes an identity even when the expected file is absent. Continue reporting `reused` and stable `state_generation` for unchanged inputs.

- [x] Reuse Task 2's authorized multi-root fixture. Parse `var/value = 1`, change only the external DM to `var/value = 2`, then request normal reparse. Require `reused: false`, a higher generation, and `Float(2.0)` from `dm_get_var`.
- [x] Add a configuration-absent fixture; create `SpacemanDMM.toml`, reparse, then change and delete it in separate cases. Require each discovery transition to invalidate reuse. Use a real diagnostic override fixture to check the resulting diagnostic behavior, not just the generation counter.
- [x] Remove the DME-parent-only input filter after applying Task 2's policy. Preserve missing/failed-input evidence so disappearing dependencies fail closed instead of silently dropping from the fingerprint.
- [x] Align source excerpts with snapshot identity: either retain the snapshot excerpt or explicitly reject/label an on-disk excerpt whose source differs. Do not silently combine current text and stale semantic locations.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test analysis_snapshot --test project_profile --lib source_fingerprint` and the parse unit tests with `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --lib tools::parse::tests`.

**Done:** the two F5 reproductions no longer reuse stale state, and an unchanged fixture still reuses the same generation.

## Task 4: Establish trustworthy compile provenance

**Files:** modify `src/tools/compile.rs`, `src/tools/rift.rs`, `src/build_provenance.rs`, and associated parameter/record documentation; extend `tests/build_provenance.rs`, `tests/compiler_runner.rs`, and `tests/rift_compile.rs`.

**Interface:** `BuildRecord` represents the effective build arguments and a complete pre-spawn source identity. Post-build comparison decides whether verified promotion is permitted. The launch gate continues to reject managed stale artifacts and expose unmanaged artifacts as unverified.

- [x] Add a controlled compiler fixture that writes a fresh DMB and exposes a synchronization point while compiling; reuse existing process-fixture conventions. This avoids making a race test depend on DreamMaker speed.
- [x] Add three red cases: a DME gains an include after the active parse; a command-line define selects a different include; and a source changes after the compiler starts but before it exits. Require unverified/stale classification unless the effective closure and consumed bytes are proved.
- [x] Capture build inputs before spawn using the effective compiler configuration. Compare input identities after completion. If the parser cannot represent a compiler-only branch, return a precise unverified reason rather than promoting the record.
- [x] Include effective defines/arguments in versioned build identity. Define compatibility behavior for older private records explicitly; preserve them and classify unsupported verification data safely.
- [x] Apply the same rule to `record_rift_provenance`. Preserve the authoritative Rift controller result and validate its artifacts; do not infer full-build freshness solely from an active analysis snapshot.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test build_provenance --test compiler_runner --test rift_compile --test runtime_integrity`. Run the owned provenance integration after the local BYOND fixture blocker has been resolved.

**Done:** edits to any file actually consumed by the selected build invalidate launch verification; a passing compiler exit alone cannot create false verified provenance.

## Task 5: Own standard runtime process trees

**Files:** modify `src/tools/runtime.rs`, `src/state.rs`, `src/mcp.rs`, and reuse `src/process.rs`; extend `tests/runtime_tools.rs`, `tests/runtime_integrity.rs`, and `tests/process_runner.rs`.

**Interface:** standard runtime state owns both the child and its containment lifetime. Shutdown terminates the owned tree before integrity finalization. Drop/owner-loss cleanup must not depend on a surviving async executor.

- [x] Add a fake runtime child that starts a descendant and emits a readiness marker. Record process identity rather than only a PID.
- [x] Test explicit stop, stdin EOF, abrupt MCP exit, and cancellation during startup. Confirm both child and descendant are gone within the bounded cleanup window and an unrelated sentinel remains alive.
- [x] Reuse `ProcessContainment` and the kill-on-drop patterns already used by compiler/debugger paths. Retain containment for the runtime lifetime instead of letting a local guard drop after launch.
- [x] Route clean transport shutdown through a bounded lifecycle finalizer. Keep a process-ownership fallback for forced termination and separately validate journal recovery.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test process_runner --test runtime_tools --test runtime_integrity` on Windows and Linux. Owned real DreamDaemon qualification follows in Task 10; this checkbox records the native process and Rust fixture gates.

**Done:** runtime ownership ends with the server or an explicit stop; cleanup never targets an arbitrary process.

## Task 6: Keep runtime controls responsive

**Files:** modify `src/tools/runtime.rs`, `src/state.rs`, and status accessors as needed; extend `tests/process_readiness.rs` and `tests/runtime_tools.rs`.

**Interface:** output waits observe a session-specific output log and notifications without retaining the runtime mutex. Every result is tied to the original session so a subsequent launch cannot satisfy an old wait.

- [x] Start the fake runtime from Task 5 and submit a missing-marker wait with `timeout_ms: 300000`. Concurrently issue status and stop.
- [x] Require each control request to complete within one second in the deterministic fixture; require the wait to terminate with the original process/session outcome.
- [x] Clone bounded observation state under the mutex, then release it before sleeping or waiting for output. Compile a requested regex once per wait, outside the polling loop.
- [x] Add a stop-then-relaunch case so old output cannot be mistaken for new readiness. Cover launch-readiness cancellation as well as explicit `dm_wait_for_output`.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test process_readiness --test runtime_tools --test server_status` and the runtime module unit tests.

**Done:** long observations no longer delay inspection or termination, while lifecycle transitions remain serialized.

## Task 5b: Restore Unix ownership after the lifecycle changes

Execution exposed that the former Unix containment adapter was a no-op. A temporary refusal prevents unowned launches while this follow-through restores standard and Tracy runtime capability. Implement after Task 6 so it uses the final session observation interfaces.

- [x] Add a small sibling guardian that owns a process group and watches a CLOEXEC owner-lifetime pipe. Keep the actual DreamDaemon child, PID, output, and exit status.
- [x] Keep the lifetime writer inherited until the target joins the guardian group before exec, closing the owner-loss launch race. Internal guardian mode runs before MCP configuration and Tokio startup.
- [x] Qualify explicit stop, EOF, owner termination, startup cancellation, natural exit, executor loss, setup failure, and descriptor inheritance in native Ubuntu fixtures. Verify owned descendants stop and an unrelated sentinel survives.
- [x] Confirm tree termination before integrity finalization on both platforms. A termination request alone is insufficient; retain ownership and leave the journal retryable on cleanup failure or timeout.
- [x] Preserve generic compiler/collector containment and Windows lifecycle behavior. State the cooperative Unix process-group boundary; deliberate group escape and independent guardian-plus-owner failure are separate guarantees.

**Done:** Unix runtime launch works again with owner-loss cleanup, and both platforms finalize integrity only after confirmed owned-tree termination.

## Task 7: Bound parse admission and cancellation

**Files:** modify `src/tools/parse.rs`, `src/state.rs`, and snapshot validation scheduling; extend parse unit tests and `tests/analysis_snapshot.rs`.

**Interface:** `timeout_ms` is a total request budget. A non-abortable worker retains exclusive parser admission until it exits, even if its caller is dropped. Failed or cancelled work does not install a new snapshot.

- [x] Add a deterministic worker barrier. Hold the first worker open and submit a second request with a short timeout. Require it to time out in the queue without starting a second worker.
- [x] Drop the first caller's future while the worker barrier remains closed. Submit another parse and assert the active-worker count never exceeds one. Release the barrier explicitly for test cleanup.
- [x] Place permit ownership in worker supervision before spawning. Use one deadline for permit acquisition, reuse validation, and parsing. Avoid an explicit-timeout-only cleanup path.
- [x] Run synchronous fingerprint validation on bounded blocking work. Preserve the cheap unchanged-snapshot route and timing fields; document whether individual stage timings include scheduling.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --lib tools::parse::tests -- --nocapture` and `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test analysis_snapshot`.

**Done:** F6's queued 1 ms request cannot wait for an unrelated full parse, and cancellation cannot cause two parser workers to coexist.

## Task 8: Bound and reuse decoded assets

**Files:** modify `src/spaceman/dmi.rs`, `src/tools/dmi.rs`, `src/state.rs`, and `src/limits.rs`; extend `tests/dmi_analysis.rs` and `tests/map_capabilities.rs` if shared loading changes.

**Interface:** unchanged content can return an existing `DecodedDmi` before pixel decode. File reads, decoder allocation, blocking jobs, and total scan residency each have enforced limits.

- [x] Add injected small-limit tests: file exceeds byte ceiling, image dimensions exceed pixel ceiling, several individually valid images exceed the scan decoded-byte ceiling, and concurrent loads exceed the configured job budget.
- [x] Add a decode counter around the decoder boundary. Repeated loads of unchanged bytes must decode once; changed bytes with preserved metadata must invalidate. Multiple references to one DMI during `audit_icons` must share one decoded asset.
- [x] Bound input reads to the ceiling plus one detection byte. Inspect dimensions and configure decoder limits before allocating full pixels.
- [x] Separate content hashing/cache lookup from decode. Coalesce concurrent same-identity loads; preserve asset generation semantics when pixels change.
- [x] Replace unbounded scan retention with bounded batches or a decoded-byte budget that counts live `Arc` references outside the cache. Apply the existing four-job setting through a shared admission mechanism.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test dmi_analysis` and relevant DMI unit tests. Record decoder counts, peak live decoded bytes, cold/warm elapsed time, and output equivalence on a representative icon fixture.

**Done:** cache hits avoid decode, and exceeding a declared limit is detected before the excessive allocation/work occurs.

## Task 9: Bound Tracy transport and shutdown

**Files:** modify `src/tracy_collector.rs`; extend `tests/tracy_protocol.rs` and `tests/tracy_tools.rs`.

**Interface:** `request_with_timeout` applies one deadline to writer acquisition, frame write, and response. Collector stop has an independent termination deadline and does not require a successful `session_stop` exchange.

- [x] Use `tokio::io::duplex(1)` with a peer that never reads. Send a valid request larger than the buffer and require a timeout within the configured total budget.
- [x] Add blocked-writer contention, caller cancellation, late response, and unterminated oversized-frame cases. Assert no pending-request leak and bounded frame storage.
- [x] Compute one deadline at entry and cover every awaited I/O stage. Ensure pending IDs are removed on write failure, timeout, cancellation, and transport failure.
- [x] Make forced child cleanup race against the absolute stop deadline even if the protocol writer remains blocked. Retain identity and process containment checks.
- [x] Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test tracy_protocol --test tracy_tools`. Follow with the pinned native and live Tracy fixture gates; portable transport tests alone do not qualify a real capture.

**Done:** blocked stdin cannot indefinitely prevent status, cancel, or stop, and oversized responses cannot grow memory past the framing limit.

## Task 10: Qualify and prepare deployment handoff

**Files:** update `TESTING.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/provenance.md`, `docs/tracy-profiling.md`, and generated `docs/tool-contracts.md` only where behavior changed. Add a dated verification report under `docs/audits/`. Update `tests/parse_reuse_scale.rs` only to separate optional corpus-specific relevance assertions from portable timing checks.

- [x] Run the exact local gates in a correctly initialized native toolchain environment:

```powershell
rustc +1.95.0 --version --verbose
cargo +1.95.0 fmt --all -- --check
cargo +1.95.0 clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --all-features
cargo +1.95.0 build --locked --release
cargo +1.95.0 deny check
```

- [x] If contracts changed, regenerate with `cargo +1.95.0 run --locked --bin render_tool_docs`, then run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test tool_contracts --test documentation`.
- [x] Run both maintained installed-binary checks against the fresh binary:

```powershell
./test_mcp.ps1 -SkipBuild -BinaryPath ./target/release/meridian-mcp.exe -Mode development
./test_mcp.ps1 -SkipBuild -BinaryPath ./target/release/meridian-mcp.exe -Mode analysis -DmePath ./tests/fixtures/language/fixture.dme -SearchQuery 'return supplied value'
```

- [x] Repeat the labeled `search_relevance` gate. For the selected real corpus, record commit and dirty state, cold/warm stage timings, request percentiles, and peak memory in at least five sequential runs without concurrent compilation. Keep the ten-query table, but do not assert Dogmos presence on a checkout without Dogmos.
- [x] Resolve the owned BYOND fixture's no-output startup blocker and run compiler/runtime/Topic/cleanup/provenance gates from `TESTING.md`. Do not substitute a full-game boot for the owned protocol tests.
- [x] Run pinned Tracy native tests and the owned live fixture. Record dropped events, control responsiveness, memory, artifact validity, journal state, and cleanup.
- [ ] Run a separately authorized real Meridian-Rift profiling session. This was not requested during local remediation.
- [ ] Run the destructive full-build compatibility script only in a disposable checkout explicitly authorized for that gate. Report hosted Windows/Linux CI separately from local checks.
- [x] Verify `git diff --check`, inspect the complete diff, scrub durable reports, and confirm only authorized changes remain. Leave everything uncommitted.
- [ ] Prepare the exact install/configuration diff and binary identity for approval if deployment is requested. After authorized installation, state that Codex must be fully quit and reopened; then verify status, parse, repeated reuse, cached diagnostics, and search through the newly exposed app tools.

**Final acceptance matrix:** every finding has a passing regression, every affected capability has a named integration result, and every unrun or blocked gate is explicit. Do not declare deployed, live-qualified, or performance-improved based only on a local Rust green.

## Current handoff state

Tasks 1–9 and the added Task 5b are implemented and independently reviewed. Authorized local Task 10 qualification is complete: Windows 388 / Linux 381 Rust tests passed, strict lint/format/dependency gates passed, both release stdio modes passed, and Windows owned runtime, provenance, debugger and full-duration Tracy fixtures passed. Five sequential real-corpus measurements and their limits are recorded in the [qualification report](../../audits/2026-09-05-remediation-verification.md). All final Windows runtime checks were repeated after the scale gate relinked the executable; the report identifies the exact final bytes.

Linux live x86 execution is unavailable on the current WSL1 host. Hosted CI, destructive full-build compatibility, real-game profiling, installation and post-restart app-tool acceptance remain separate unrun gates. Changes remain uncommitted.

## Follow-up identified during qualification: debugger stop latency

The owned headless auxtools fixture passes all six requests, but `dm_debug_stop` takes about 30 seconds. This separate debugger protocol was not changed by the Tracy transport work.

- [ ] Confirm the pinned auxtools disconnect response contract and add a nonresponsive-peer regression covering blocked send and absent acknowledgement.
- [ ] Give debugger stop one bounded deadline independent of protocol completion; retain actual process ownership through confirmed cleanup and preserve honest failure outcomes.
- [ ] Repeat the owned debugger fixture and record stop latency, peer-failure behavior, cancellation and process cleanup. Establish the shutdown latency target before implementation.

This is the next implementation item, not an applied fix. The qualification report retains the observed 30,027 ms stop call and the relevant source path.
