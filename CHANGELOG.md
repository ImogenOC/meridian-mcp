## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added deterministic `dm_search_context` ranking over parsed DreamMaker symbols, documentation, source excerpts, and file paths.
- Added provenance, source-authority, compatibility, dependency, and security records.
- Added independent Windows/Ubuntu over-64K parser evidence and Ubuntu/Windows control-versus-boundary DreamDaemon evidence.
- Added source fingerprinting to `dm_parse_environment` so an unchanged environment reuses the active snapshot instead of reparsing, reported as `reused: true` with an unchanged state generation. Measured on a ~10,000-file, 65,000-type environment, a redundant reparse fell from about 35 seconds to under half a second. Files modified within two seconds of the check are always reparsed, because filesystem timestamp granularity cannot prove an edit in that window did not happen.
- Added `force` and `timeout_ms` arguments to `dm_parse_environment`. A parse that exceeds its timeout is abandoned with a structured error; because a blocking parse cannot be cancelled, the worker keeps running and the next parse queues behind it rather than running alongside it.
- Added error and warning counts, parse duration, the canonical environment path, and the pinned SpacemanDMM revision to the `dm_parse_environment` result, so diagnostic volume no longer needs a second `dm_check_errors` call to discover.

### Changed

- Serialized `dm_parse_environment` so overlapping calls queue instead of each building a complete object tree, and stopped holding the previous snapshot alive for the duration of a parse. Both removed a doubled peak memory footprint on large environments.
- Built the post-parse indexes concurrently and centralized detection of the parser diagnostics that mean an environment was never fully read, with a test pinning that wording to the SpacemanDMM revision it is matched against.
- Made `dm_parse_environment` reject a directory or missing path as a structured error before parsing, rather than reporting it as a parser failure.

- Made workflow contract parsing portable across LF and CRLF checkouts, and made the explicitly diagnostic Windows synthetic runtime lane retain evidence as a warning while Ubuntu remains the required compatibility gate.

- Defined analysis and development capability modes and evidence-based support labels.
- Clarified that `dm_compile` is a direct DreamMaker gate rather than a repository full build.
- Separated real Windows Meridian-Rift, synthetic BYOND runtime, parser-boundary, and Linux Tracy jobs so one specialized failure cannot suppress unrelated evidence.

### Removed

- Removed the unsupported inherited BYOND client-login protocol and `dm_connect_test` from the target supported product; `world.Topic()` remains separate.

### Fixed

- Read DreamDaemon `-logself` files so readiness markers and runtime output are available on Windows.
- Replaced the fixed synthetic DreamDaemon port and ambiguous 60-second missing-marker failure with port-zero launch, a five-minute wall ceiling, bounded process telemetry, explicit classifications, and verified cleanup evidence.
- Separated the flat parser stress corpus from the bucketed BYOND runtime corpus so the latter crosses 64K total declarations without testing DreamMaker's direct-child ceiling instead.
- Made synthetic runtime version provenance portable to Linux and bound its temporary DreamDaemon listener explicitly to loopback for headless hosted runners.
- Correct BYOND Topic request framing and response decoding for string and float responses.
- Parse DMM/TGM maps with SpacemanDMM for exact dimensions, instance counts, and coordinates.
- Render actual map PNGs through the SpacemanDMM minimap pipeline.
- Return type children and documentation, proc documentation and accurate body metadata, and variable documentation and declared types.
- Return experimental full-client handshake failures as structured tool errors instead of JSON-RPC internal errors.
