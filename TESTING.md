# Testing Meridian-MCP

Run checks from the repository root with PowerShell 7 on Windows or Linux.

## Rust and contract gates

The checked-in `rust-toolchain.toml` pins Rust 1.95.0 with rustfmt and Clippy, matching CI and the pinned SpacemanDMM workspace MSRV. Do not override that toolchain when reproducing a CI failure; confirm the verbose compiler identity before trusting a local green result.

```powershell
rustc +1.95.0 --version --verbose
cargo +1.95.0 fmt --all -- --check
cargo +1.95.0 clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --all-features
cargo +1.95.0 build --locked --release
cargo +1.95.0 deny check
```

The suite covers owned DreamMaker and DMM fixtures, parse generations, complete registered-input reuse, exact lookup and source excerpts, lexical retrieval judgments, semantic chunk identities, map coordinates and PNG output, path containment, executable allowlisting, overwrite policy, mode inventories, runtime buffering, readiness, `Topic()` framing, generated contract drift, and documentation links.

The audit regressions use small owned inputs and deterministic worker/process barriers. Run the focused ownership gates after building the actual server executable, because Unix tests launch its private guardian entry point:

```powershell
cargo +1.95.0 build --locked
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --lib runtime_ownership_tests -- --nocapture
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test process_runner --test process_readiness --test runtime_tools --test runtime_integrity
```

On Linux also run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --lib process::unix_owner -- --nocapture`. Ignored fixture entry points in these modules are invoked by their parent tests; running every ignored test directly is not a useful suite. The tests cover owner termination, EOF, cancellation, descendants, unrelated sentinels, failed cleanup retries, and control responsiveness. [Runtime ownership](docs/runtime-ownership.md) explains the platform scope. Synthetic ownership tests remain separate from the real engine and live Tracy gates below.

Snapshot tests cover authorized external includes, configuration discovery, canonical aliases, missing required inputs, and retained proc excerpts. Parse barrier tests cover total request deadlines and worker admission after caller cancellation. The metadata reuse fingerprint does not detect deliberate changes preserving both file length and modification time; build provenance and DMI content identity use separate byte hashes.

Run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test dmi_analysis --test map_capabilities` for bounded input/inflation, cache identity, PNG parity and scan residency. DMI unit tests cover bounded reader consumption; the state admission regression keeps cancelled workers behind a barrier to prove their permits stay owned. [DMI resource limits](docs/dmi-resource-limits.md) records the default limits, rejected APNG format, serialized decoding and cold-load inflation tradeoff. The representative fixture's decode count and output equivalence are acceptance evidence; its elapsed time alone is not a production performance result.

The fixed search fixture is the relevance acceptance gate:

```powershell
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test search_relevance -- --nocapture
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --lib semantic::tests -- --nocapture
```

Its schema-1 labels require exact-identifier MRR 1.0 and natural-language recall@10 1.0. Do not weaken a label to accommodate a ranking regression. The semantic tests cover stable repository-relative document/chunk IDs, content digests, 40-line chunks with five-line overlap, and independence from embedding-model identity. These gates do not claim that dense retrieval exists.

The repository's checked-in cross-platform text policy is LF, including PowerShell and owned DreamMaker fixtures. Do not rewrite files to CRLF to satisfy a Windows-only observation. Parsers and contract tests that consume external text must accept both LF and CRLF explicitly; use `git diff --check` and the checked-in `.gitattributes` as the repository authority rather than a developer's `core.autocrlf` setting.

## Tracy native gates

First run `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --test tracy_protocol --test tracy_tools` and `cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --lib tracy -- --nocapture`. These cover blocked writes, cancellation, late responses, bounded framing, actual child EOF/termination, failed cleanup retries and journal retention. A bounded error is distinct from confirmed process exit; synthetic transport gates do not qualify a live capture.

Check out Tracy and byond-tracy at the exact revisions recorded in `tracy-capabilities.json`, then build from those local sources. The builder never downloads source and merges its schema-v2 entries into an existing dmdoc manifest.

```powershell
./scripts/build-tracy-helpers.ps1 `
    -TracyPath C:\path\to\tracy `
    -ByondTracyPath C:\path\to\byond-tracy `
    -OutputDirectory ./target/tracy-package `
    -ManifestPath ./target/tracy-package/helpers/manifest.json
```

This runs only the Meridian-owned CTests, builds the host x86_64 fixed-command helper and x86 BYOND hook, records SHA-256 hashes, and copies both licenses. Windows uses x86 MSVC; Ubuntu requires CMake, a C++20 compiler, PowerShell, and `gcc-multilib`. Native helper build success is not live BYOND compatibility evidence.

For an installed opt-in session, pass `-EnableTracy` to both installation/configuration scripts, start Codex after configuration, then exercise `prepare`, `launch`, `capture`, offline analysis, `status`, and `stop` against the pinned BYOND fixture. A real Meridian-Rift smoke remains a separate named gate and must not modify `BUILD.cmd`.

Run installed sessions with analysis/disabled, development/disabled, development/offline, and development/network startup configurations when changing contract visibility or build policy. The startup ceiling is immutable; `network_mode=allow` must fail under an offline ceiling.

## Installed stdio gate

```powershell
$binaryPath = if ($IsWindows) { ".\target\release\meridian-mcp.exe" } else { "./target/release/meridian-mcp" }

./test_mcp.ps1 -SkipBuild -ServerPath $binaryPath -Mode development
./test_mcp.ps1 -SkipBuild -ServerPath $binaryPath -Mode analysis `
    -DmePath ./tests/fixtures/language/fixture.dme `
    -SearchQuery "return supplied value"
```

These two installed-binary checks run on Windows and Ubuntu 24.04 in per-change CI. The harness sets immutable roots for every supplied fixture, negotiates through the official SDK, validates JSON-only stdout, checks the exact mode inventory and schemas, exercises caller-visible error paths, and parses and searches an owned DreamMaker fixture. `-ServerPath` and `-BinaryPath` are aliases.

## BYOND fixture gate

```powershell
.\scripts\run-byond-integration.ps1
```

This compiles the purpose-written runtime fixture with DreamMaker. To exercise the runtime, `Topic()`, map output, and clean shutdown through the installed binary:

```powershell
.\test_mcp.ps1 -SkipBuild -Mode development `
    -DmePath .\tests\fixtures\language\fixture.dme `
    -RuntimeDmbPath .\tests\fixtures\runtime\runtime.dmb `
    -RuntimeReadyMarker MERIDIAN_MCP_READY `
    -RuntimeTopic ping -ExpectedTopicResponse pong `
    -MapDmmPath .\tests\fixtures\maps\fixture.dmm
```

The managed provenance and runtime-integrity fixture is separate. It compiles only the owned fixture, proves changed-input and failed-compile stale rejection across an MCP restart, restores the original bytes explicitly, then requires a fresh verified launch and reports the tracked runtime mutation without reverting it:

```powershell
./scripts/run-provenance-integrity-integration.ps1 `
    -DreamMakerPath 'C:\Program Files (x86)\BYOND\bin\dm.exe' `
    -BinaryPath ./target/release/meridian-mcp.exe `
    -EvidencePath ./integration/evidence/local-provenance-integrity.json

./scripts/test-provenance-evidence-validation.ps1 `
    -EvidencePath ./integration/evidence/local-provenance-integrity.json
```

The evidence document is schema 1 and bounded to 256 KiB. It omits raw stdout/stderr, absolute profile paths, private-state records, source copies, DMB/RSC files, and player/account identifiers.

The named BYOND 516.1687 workflow separates parser, synthetic runtime, and real Windows product evidence. Verify the parser boundary independently through the release MCP:

```powershell
.\scripts\run-large-prototype-parser-integration.ps1 `
    -BinaryPath .\target\release\meridian-mcp.exe `
    -EvidencePath .\integration\evidence\large-prototype-parser.json
```

The parser gate uses a compact flat declaration layout and resolves the first, boundary, and last declared paths. It does not start DreamMaker or DreamDaemon. The synthetic runtime uses 256-child buckets so it exceeds 64K total declarations without hitting DreamMaker's separate direct-child limit. Run a bucketed control before the boundary fixture:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-auxtools-runtime.ps1
.\scripts\run-large-prototype-integration.ps1 `
    -DreamMakerPath 'C:\path\to\BYOND\bin\dm.exe' `
    -PrototypeCount 50000 -RuntimeCase control `
    -EvidencePath .\integration\evidence\prototype-control.json

.\scripts\run-large-prototype-integration.ps1 `
    -DreamMakerPath 'C:\path\to\BYOND\bin\dm.exe' `
    -PrototypeCount 65537 -RuntimeCase boundary `
    -ControlEvidencePath .\integration\evidence\prototype-control.json `
    -EvidencePath .\integration\evidence\prototype-boundary.json
```

The fixtures are generated in temporary directories and removed after successful gates. DreamDaemon uses an ephemeral port bound to `127.0.0.1`; the synthetic world is never intentionally exposed beyond the runner. A readiness marker is required; a successful DreamMaker compile or live process alone is insufficient. Evidence classifies `passed`, `compile_failure`, `environment_failure`, `boundary_regression`, or `inconclusive_timeout` and retains bounded process metrics, logs, events, version provenance, and cleanup state.

The hosted workflow uses Ubuntu as the required synthetic BYOND engine lane. Windows synthetic startup remains diagnostic until three consecutive scheduled or manual runs pass. The Windows job independently requires real Meridian-Rift compatibility, the owned auxtools protocol fixture, and the owned Tracy live fixture; it has no dependency on the synthetic jobs.

Run the auxtools protocol gate without a full-game boot:

```powershell
.\scripts\run-auxtools-integration.ps1 `
    -DreamMakerPath 'C:\path\to\BYOND\bin\dm.exe' `
    -BinaryPath .\target\release\meridian-mcp.exe `
    -EvidencePath .\integration\evidence\auxtools-compatibility.json `
    -HostMode headless
```

Supplying `-DmbPath` remains an explicit full-game diagnostic. It is not the required native protocol gate because repository initialization time is unrelated to auxtools wire compatibility.

To run the hosted check without opening a pull request, open the repository's **Actions** tab, select **BYOND integration**, choose **Run workflow**, supply the intended Meridian-Rift ref, and start the run. The artifacts are `windows-meridian-compatibility-evidence`, `prototype-parser-windows-evidence`, `prototype-parser-ubuntu-evidence`, `prototype-runtime-windows-evidence`, `prototype-runtime-ubuntu-evidence`, and `tracy-linux-compatibility-evidence`.

Before testing an installation/configuration change, run the parser and private temporary-file round trips:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem ./scripts -Filter *.ps1 | ForEach-Object {
    $null = [scriptblock]::Create((Get-Content -LiteralPath $_.FullName -Raw))
}
./scripts/test-configure-codex-meridian-mcp.ps1
./scripts/test-meridian-evidence-validation.ps1
./scripts/test-provenance-evidence-validation.ps1
```

## Meridian-Rift full corpus

```powershell
.\test_mcp.ps1 -SkipBuild -Mode analysis `
    -DmePath C:\path\to\Meridian-Rift\tgstation.dme `
    -SearchQuery "storage navigation exit button" `
    -TimeoutSeconds 300
```

Parsing/search is MCP evidence. Run Meridian-Rift's own PowerShell and `BUILD.cmd` gates before claiming game-code completion. A focused fixture or query is iteration evidence, not the full acceptance matrix.

The snapshot-reuse gate measures the `dm_parse_environment` short-circuit at real scale. It is ignored by default because it needs a full checkout, and it only reads that checkout:

```powershell
$env:MERIDIAN_SCALE_DME = 'C:\path\to\Meridian-Rift\tgstation.dme'
cargo +1.95.0 test --locked --release --test parse_reuse_scale -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Run it in release; a debug parse is slow enough to obscure the comparison. It asserts that reusing an unchanged environment is decisively cheaper than parsing it and that reuse does not install a new state generation. It also runs the ten audit queries, prints per-query latency, candidates, scored documents, top symbols, median and maximum latency, and samples process memory immediately before parsing and after snapshot installation. Set `MERIDIAN_SCALE_EXPECT_DOGMOS=1` only when the selected corpus includes Dogmos; the canonical-symbol assertion remains unconditional. Cache invalidation on edit is proved at fixture scale by the unit tests, which do not need to mutate a real checkout. Reuse, query, and memory values vary with the host and cache warmth; treat one run as iteration evidence and compare changes on the same host.

A future dense backend adds separate acceptance requirements: labeled hybrid relevance, ANN recall against exact nearest-neighbor results, embedding/provider/dimension migration tests, payload indexes for selective filters, immutable generation builds, and an atomic active-generation swap. None is required while `dense.status` remains `not_configured`; enabling dense retrieval without those gates is not acceptable.

The named Windows integration uses:

```powershell
.\scripts\run-meridian-compatibility.ps1 `
    -BinaryPath .\target\release\meridian-mcp.exe `
    -MeridianRiftRoot C:\path\to\Meridian-Rift `
    -DreamMakerPath 'C:\Program Files (x86)\BYOND\bin\dm.exe' `
    -EvidencePath .\integration\evidence\meridian-compatibility.json
```

This destructive integration gate is intended for a disposable checkout: it removes only root `tgstation.dmb` and `tgstation.rsc` between gates. It runs the manifest, direct `dm_compile`, forced network `rift_compile`, warm human `BUILD.cmd`, forced offline `rift_compile`, and negative policy/state sessions. Evidence is written even on failure. Offline controls are cooperative preflight, not a firewall, and network samples are always incomplete.

Ubuntu CI runs `scripts/test_unsupported_rift_compile.ps1` against the release binary. It validates portable stale-schema behavior only and must not install BYOND or attempt the Windows wrapper.
